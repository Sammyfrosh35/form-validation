## My process
Went through series of contemplation in choosong between desktop views but got to choose one later and i designed the whole interface before moving to write the logics.


## bult with
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned


i learnt how to make use of the input tag for different data and most importantly i found a new way to display errors using the toast toastify library in react and positioning the notification.
and i also improved in making use of useState and passing props to functions.


### Useful resources

MDN web docs was really an insighful resource to use in web developmen.(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/date)
